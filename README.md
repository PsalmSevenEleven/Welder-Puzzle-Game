A short puzzle game I made to begin learning C++.
The player character is entirely C++ with a Blueprint child class for ease of variable assignment, and the weldable blocks are a hybrid of C++ and Blueprint logic.
If you see a way to improve my code (more elegant implementation, better performance, etc), please let me know in the discussion or issues.
